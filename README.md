# ETL-Data-Pipeline
## In this Project, I built an ETL Data Pipeline. 
## A data pipeline is a systematics and automated process for the efficient and reliable movement, transformation and management of data from one point to another within a computing environment. It is a method in which raw data is ingested from various data sources, transformed and then ported to a data store such as a data lake, data warehouse or a database.
